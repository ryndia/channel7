# Channel 7

"Channel 7" is a Laravel project that was initially started for a client but was later canceled due to unforeseen reasons. The project was then continued as a showcase of my knowledge in the Laravel framework. Some of the code is not clean due to the pressure of quickly delivering code to the client. The project is currently being updated to achieve optimized status.

The "Channel 7" project introduced me to PHP, the MVC model, JavaScript, jQuery, Meilisearch, MySQL, Docker, Composer, and Artisan.
